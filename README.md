# Rickshaw-wala-Income-Simulator
This program observes income, calculates fares based on distance, and lets users (customers) choose destinations from ULAB, Mohammadpur, Dhaka. It introduces features like minimum fares and higher fares after a specific number of trips. 

Functionalities:

User interaction: Users can choose destinations from a list or enter custom ones.
Fare calculation: Fares are calculated based on distance segments multiplied by a base fare. Increased fare applies after a certain number of trips.
Income tracking: The program tracks the total income earned throughout the day.

Current Limitation:

1. Single-word Custom Destinations: The program currently allows users to enter only one-word custom destinations. This simplifies distance lookup but may not capture full addresses or landmarks.

2. Fixed Destinations and Distances: The program might rely on a pre-defined list of destinations with fixed distances. This wouldn't account for real-world variations in distance depending on the specific route taken.

3. Static Fare Calculation: The fare calculation might use a base fare and distance segments, which is a simplified approach. Real-world fares might consider factors like traffic congestion or time of day.

4. No Real-time Integration: The program might not integrate with real-time traffic data or map APIs. This would limit the accuracy of distance calculations and estimated travel time.
